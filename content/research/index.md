# Interests

I’m interested in how humans think, learn, and make decisions, especially when we are short on computation and memory. I like to start from theory and build computational models (with symbolic reps, e.g., program induction) and test them through online experiments.

My PhD focuses on human resource rationality and intrinsic motivation, with a special interest in how these play out in real-world education.

Recent in my mind: not just how we learn and make decisions, but why we value certain outcomes in the first place. What shapes our sense of what’s worth pursuing? How our utility functions, our goals or values, are formed over time? 
How do we model long-term influences like evolution and culture (religion or shared belief systems), as well as more immediate ones like communication (social interaction and family story) and, of course, pedagogy?
