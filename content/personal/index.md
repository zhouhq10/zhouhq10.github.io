#### When I am not in front of my desk

I enjoy all kinds of "moving", including hiking, skiing and yoga. I’m also trying to get back into bouldering - slowly because my knees have started sending passive-aggressive messages.  
When I’m not in motion, I’m deep in a TV show binge and reading.  
This site is a little peek into some work, some wanderings, and a bunch of things in between.
